<p>Bart is an 8th grader at Mt. Greylock High School whose class has gone on a field trip to visit the Williams College Museum of Art. Bart doesn’t mind art, though he isn’t exactly a huge fan of it and definitely isn’t excited about listening to his art teacher Ms. Rebeccarte wax poetic about the different exhibits. Unfortunately, Bart’s best and only friend Artem is out sick today. Because of this, not only is he lonely, but he’s also unable to make comments about the art to his friend as per usual, and thus is left without a way to have his funny comments appreciated without participating in Ms. Rebeccarte’s discussion. </p>

<p>Carter is a college student who has never visited an art museum in his free time. He is spending the summer at his college campus in the middle of nowhere, and figures it can’t hurt to go to the campus’ art museum. In the museum, he feels overwhelmed by the first exhibit he visits. He has never seen art like these pieces. He wishes he had come along with someone else so he could hear their thoughts on the pieces; maybe they could help him orient his own thoughts. If he knew what other people thought about these art pieces, he could develop his own thoughts and compare them with others. </p>

<p>Artemis is a new father. On this rainy Sunday afternoon, he has brought his 8 month-old to WCMA. Artemis is not an art connoisseur, and doesn’t usually care much for museums, but he decided to visit WCMA anyways, in hopes of lulling his daughter to sleep as he walks the quiet museum halls. Fortunately, this worked like a charm and Artemis spent the time gazing at the artworks as he pushed the stroller around. Happening upon a particularly beautiful oil painting of a father and son, Artemis was surprised to find himself tearing up-- he doesn’t usually feel any connection with art. The piece reminded him so much of an early memory of his own father that his emotions overcame him. In that moment, so tangible was the passing of time and the circle of life that he felt he had to share this memory. </p>

<p>Martina is a 22-year-old banker who works in New York City. She lives a 15-minute walk away from the Met. Her banking colleagues are constantly inviting her to spend an evening at the Met with them, but Martina always claims she is busy and never ends up attending. Martina really likes all of her colleagues (except for Arturo who she finds to be a bit stuffy to be honest), and she wants to spend time with them. But every time she has visited an art museum in the past, she felt out of place and slightly lost. Martina never really understood art, and she is worried that if she goes to the Met with her colleagues, she won’t be able to contribute to meaningful conversations about art. She is worried that people (especially Arturo) will judge her for her opinions, and therefore she avoids art museums (and as a result, her friends) like bankers avoid taxes.</p>

<h2 id="viewcommentsfromandfeelcommunitywithpeoplewhoshareyourideas_moderate_">View comments from and feel community with people who share your ideas <em>(MODERATE)</em></h2>

<p>Marta is an English major at Williams and a comedy enthusiast who loves making puns. Often, those puns are sadly not appreciated by her peers; however through her involvement with college comedy and improv groups, she has found a community of peers that understand her humor. Outside of this group, however, Marta is less outgoing, loud or willing to share her opinions. One summer day, while her parents are visiting her at Williams, they drag Marta to WCMA (her least favorite place). Begrudgingly, she tags along. While wandering around the museum, she stumbles upon a painting of six sheep on a purple canvas. Her mind immediately goes to the pun “Sheeph” (like eph but but sheep). Sadly, there is no one around to share the pun with. Marta wishes, in that moment, that she could find and connect with other people who love and understand art-based puns.</p>

<h2 id="receivevalidationaboutyourownartopinionsnomatterhowridiculoustheymayseem_difficult_">Receive validation about your own art opinions, no matter how ridiculous they may seem <em>(DIFFICULT)</em></h2>

<p>Cartney has never been to an art museum by herself. When she does go to art museums, she goes with her friends who major in art history. Her friends talk a lot about the art they see, making many intelligent-sounding comments. Cartney feels insecure about her own thoughts on art; she hasn’t forgotten the time her friends laughed at her when she said she “liked the cows” in a painting. She thinks she would express her random thoughts on pieces of art if people were more accepting of and even agreed with her ideas.</p>
