<p>We conducted our first usability test in what we call ‘The Sheep Gallery:’ a schow study room set up to simulate a museum exhibit. For our participant, we selected a Williams student who described herself as being an art amateur who does not frequent museums and does not care very much about art. These choices of location and individual were made based on the following rationale. The primary audience for our design is people who feel uncomfortable in art museums because they think their opinions and thoughts about art are unusual or don’t belong. Although our design would be usable by anyone, we want to ensure that it is especially usable (and valuable) for an art amateur. As such, we have chosen an art amateur as the subject of our Usability Test. In our simulated gallery, we drew pieces of artwork on the chalkboards, and mounted our interactive display on a wall. The purpose of simulating an art gallery is to provide a realistic scenario in which our design would be used, and place the user in realistic conditions while still having an uninterrupted, quiet environment. </p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Dyjralh.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<p>We began the test by providing the individual with some context, so as to reduce the artificiality of the tasks and experience. We informed the user of their current situation: they are a person entering WCMA who likes art, but does not visit art museums often and does not usually feel entirely comfortable in them. The user was then made aware that the museum has a feature that allows members to share their emotional responses to artworks and see them appear on a large interactive display in the corresponding exhibit. By looking around the mock museum we constructed in Schow, the participant can see various artworks, as well as the large interactive display. We have designed this usability test such that the participant has already opted-in to the program at the start of the test, and has the web-app open on their smartphone, which we provide. The user is then asked to explore the museum as they would, trying out the feature as they go. We explain to the user the following tasks, without describing how exactly to accomplish them.</p>

<p><em>Task 1:</em> Sharing Emotions: Find a piece of art and share an emotional response. Figure out how many people felt the same way as you.</p>

<p><em>Task 2:</em> Commenting: Leave a comment about an artwork and see how people who felt differently reacted. </p>

<p>In leaving the mechanisms of task completion unexplained, we under-specify the tasks so as to elicit the confusion and decision-making that might arise in real life use. </p>

<p>Reflecting on our first usability test, it is clear that our protocol worked quite well. We experienced few issues with the actual procedure of the test. Our test affirmed the virtues of task underspecification and participant narration, as our participant verbally communicated her thought process as she figured out our prototype, which allowed us to understand design issues we could not see ourselves. One revision to our protocol we plan to make for our next usability tests is to explain in more detail the large interactive display and how it works. Our participant, Stewart had no idea that our paper mockup of the display was meant to be a touch screen with tap and swipe capability. These fundamental aspects of our paper prototype must be communicated so that our participants can navigate the simulation. Overall, however, our first usability test went smoothly. </p>

<h1 id="cognitivewalkthroughresultsandrevisions">Cognitive Walkthrough Results and Revisions</h1>

<h3 id="issue1">Issue 1</h3>

<p>The button to share an emotional response simply says “Share”, which has online / social network connotations. This violates walk-through question 3: “Will user recognize actions as the correct one?” with a severity of 2.</p>

<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9f26dfbb736aa908a989aa9e73b7f86fd93e58e1/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6c4931555742492e6a7067" alt="Github" /></p>
<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZFDWHcf.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<p>We have revised the share button to say “submit” instead, with an additional descriptive blurb to make it clear that the user will be brought to a screen showing how other people reacted.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vd3rCoL.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></p>
<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZFDWHcf.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<h3 id="issue2">Issue 2</h3>

<p>There is no indicator in the early stages of the phone webapp that the user will actually be able to submit their responses and see what other people felt. This violates walk-through question 3, “Will user recognize actions as the correct one?” with a severity of 2.</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f2b1fd0d7dc1bf0f8eb395089b0e5e433e3006fc/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f765149644365642e6a7067" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<p>We have added a “?” button to the homepage of the webapp (the sensing for artwork page) that directs the user to a blurb about the basic functionality of the app. We also slightly changed the wording on the homepage to make it clear that the user should approach a piece of art.</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cTsuf4o.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<h2 id="incidents">Incidents</h2>

<h3 id="incident1">Incident 1</h3>

<p>The user found the purpose of many different buttons in the prototype, such as the submit button and the question mark that we added in the cognitive walkthrough, to be clear.</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vd3rCoL.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cTsuf4o.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<h3 id="incident2">Incident 2</h3>

<p>The user was told on the phone comments page to check out the large interactive display for more results, but was confused because the phone could also be considered a large-ish interactive display. We rate this issue as 2 on the severity scale.</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lX4Pwug.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<p>We added a hyperlink to the comments page that says “See more at the nearest display”. When tapped, this link takes the user to a map of the exhibit they are in with a highlighted location of the interactive display and an icon indicating the user’s current location.</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HYT4vqj.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<h3 id="incident3">Incident 3</h3>

<p>The user approached the large screen, and was confused about whether they were able / supposed to select a painting. We rate this issue as 1 on the severity scale.</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/70cca5459a0b385dd39cde296925f9f5a756ecf4/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f643451434167362e6a7067" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<p>We added a sentence “Tap an artwork to explore!” to the homepage of the large screen to make the purpose of this page more clear.</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nBvcG6n.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<h3 id="incident4">Incident 4</h3>

<p>The user could not tell that they were able to scroll through the visualization of paintings on the main page of the large screen. We rate this issue as 2 on the severity scale.</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/70cca5459a0b385dd39cde296925f9f5a756ecf4/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f643451434167362e6a7067" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<p>We added arrows to the sides of the homepage of the large screen to indicate scrolling ability.</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sJaTpPN.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<h3 id="incident5">Incident 5</h3>

<p>The user was confused by the display of blank, unhighlighted people on the “Filter by Feeling” screen, and could not tell if any emotion or group of people were supposed to already be selected. We rate this issue as 2 on the severity scale.</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cPpef6I.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<p>We decided that in the actual display, an emotion will always be highlighted and the corresponding group of people will always be highlighted. This will make it clearer to the user that they can select an emotion to filter the crowd of people by that emotion. We also wrote a blurb on the side of this page to indicate that the visualization represents all of the people who reacted to the feeling.</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YNMOC8i.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<h3 id="incident6">Incident 6</h3>

<p>The user was confused by the button depicting a pencil on the large screen’s reply page, which is meant to indicate the option to write a comment versus typing a comment. We rate this issue as 2 on the severity scale.</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VrD0Tus.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<p>We’ve added two larger buttons on the side of the large screen’s comment box that say “TYPE” and “WRITE” (with WRITE in more of a handwritten font). If you touch “TYPE”, a keyboard will pop up. If you touch “WRITE”, a pop-up says “Write your comment with one of the styluses located next to the screen!”</p>

<h2 id="taskwalkthroughs">Task Walkthroughs</h2>

<h3 id="task1sharingemotionsfindapieceofartandshareanemotionalresponsefigureouthowmanypeoplefeltthesamewayasyou">Task 1: Sharing Emotions: Find a piece of art and share an emotional response. Figure out how many people felt the same way as you.</h3>

<p>The user begins on their phone's camera screen. A QR code at the front desk of the museum brings the user to the Amarteurs webpage.</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Gzw1pIp.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<p>The user arrives at the Amarteurs webpage where they are asked for permission to run the webapp. If they hit Decline, the prototype is over. If they hit Accept, they will be brought to the app's idle screen.</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CxbzQbG.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<p>Here is the idle screen of the webapp, waiting for the user to approach a piece of art.</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CxccdS1.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<p>The user approaches a piece of art and is prompted to select how they feel. They can tap to select an emotion from the different emojis below the piece of art. </p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7kO6Cjz.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<p>The user has chosen their reaction emoji. They are shown a screen with the reaction they've chosen, with the option to go back or submit their reaction. If they go back, they return to the previous screen with the possible emotions and the photo of the piece of art. If they choose to submit, they are brought to the next screen.</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bu2jcta.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<p>The user has chosen to share their reaction emoji. They are told the number of people who felt the same way (chose similar reactions) and are shown that number of faces with the same expression as the one they chose. The user sees that other people reacted the same way they did (the numbers are slightly fudged so that some minimum number of people are always shown to have reacted similarly).</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YMGF1Er.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<h3 id="task2commentingleaveacommentaboutanartworkandseehowpeoplewhofeltdifferentlyreacted">Task 2: Commenting: Leave a comment about an artwork and see how people who felt differently reacted.</h3>

<p>Beginning where they left off, the user can tap the "Comment" button to progress to the next screen.</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YMGF1Er.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<p>This screen asks the user to type a comment. They can tap the send button to submit their comment. The comment is pre-prepared in the paper prototype.</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uE8BqZi.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<p>The user has submitted their comment and is taken to a screen with comments in speech bubbles. These comments were deemed "similar" to the user's comment, and the words that triggered the similarity algorithm are <strong>bolded</strong>. If other people had similar thoughts, the user is shown that other people had similar thoughts and is thus validated. Otherwise, the user is still shown a list of comments that are deemed closest. They are prompted to go to the large screen if they want to see more comments, and can click the button over this text to go to a map showing the location of the screen.</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/COkigPh.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<p>The user has gone to the board. In its initial state, it has a visualization of the exhibit with paintings surrounded by hues representing peoples' reactions to that art piece. The user is prompted to select an art piece by tapping. In the prototype they should choose "One Sheep, Two Sheep".</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/enjCMnn.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<p>The user has selcted a painting by tapping on it. There are a bunch of silhouettes congregated at the painting and a list of emojis at the bottom to choose from to see how many people chose that specific emotion and what they commented.</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7vYdJyI.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<p>The user has tapped an emotion (<em>Angry</em> in this prototype) and now sees the highlighted silhouettes of people who reacted with this emotion. They are also shown comment bubbles coming from the highlighted silhouettes. Tapping the comment bubbles takes the user to a thread of comments from that group</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IiHyYQa.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<p>The user has pressed the comment bubbles and sees all of the comments associated with that reaction lain out. The user can tap "See Thread" next to a comment if there are existing replies and can directly tap the reply button to move to the replying screen.</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FBLfHLZ.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<p>The user tapped the "See Replies" button and now sees all of the replies to that comment uncollapsed. The user can reply to any of these comments using the keyboard.</p>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SyT92Kr.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/j7WXGb4.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></span></div>

<h2 id="reflectionsandfuturetests">Reflections and Future Tests</h2>

<h3 id="whatwelearned">What We Learned</h3>

<p>Our first usability testing affirmed the virtues of underspecification. We only provided our participant with information about the setting they were in and a basic explanation of the tasks we wanted them to complete. We did not provide any information about the web app itself, and therefore we were able to assess whether the steps to complete those tasks were easy to uncover from the design. It was valuable to watch our participant react to the different screens that they came into contact with and we were able to gauge how first time users of our design would respond. This also allowed use to properly identify points where the outcome of a certain action was surprising or unexpected for the user. These were some of the points that we have identified as weaknesses.</p>

<p>One thing we did find during this process was that the guidelines we had prepared before the usability test did not cover all of the important information that we ended up needing to provide our participant. For example. We had not anticipated needing to explain some of the visual components of the interactive display (especially those components that involved motion or dynamic visualizations and therefore could not be effectively represented by our paper prototype). We have noted this added information for future usability tests.</p>

<h3 id="lookingforward">Looking Forward</h3>

<p>For our future usability tests, we will continue to target Williams college students who consider themselves art amateurs. However, we think it would be interesting to diversify our participants slightly to understand a broader user-base. In particular, we plan to run a usability test with one non-amateur (aka someone is well versed with or spends a decent amount of time with art) to see how people outside of our primary intended user-base would interact with our design. We feel this is valuable since our current design, while intended for a specific group of people, would be accessible to all museum-goers. We also feel this outside perspective would enhance our design and make it more robust for a variety of users. </p>

<p>With our remaining usability tests, we hope to determine whether the revisions we have made after this first usability test resolve the issues that were uncovered. Hopefully these tests will reveal any issues that have persisted despite our changes and potentially reveal any new issues that our first participant may not have identified. We would also generally like to get more feedback about the design to ensure that it is effective at making art amateurs feel comfortable in art museums.</p>
